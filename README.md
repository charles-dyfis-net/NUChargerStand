Naztech Ultimate Charger Stand
------------------------------

Like your Naztech Ultimate Wireless Power Station, but want it to stand upright so you can see your phone's screen while it charges? Want to have your phone always at the right height to be positioned just over the charge pad?

This parameterized OpenSCAD design constructs a charger that's just right for the size of your phone (with its case &c. attached), and the angle you want it held at (within some limitations).

The current version doesn't try to be particularly minimal with material usage. Supports are required; Cura LE 3.6.12's tree support functionality has been used successfully -- though an easier-to-print multi-part design could well happen in the future.
